                <div class="col-sm-8">Digital marketing has forced a change in perspective and compelled the marketing department to take aid from technology, to be precise big data, to pass on their marketing message across the right channels.    
                    The digital age has brought with it huge volumes of data. Big data offers great insight which can be used by the marketers to make better marketing strategies. 
                    A direct benefit of this is that the companies can develop better content with the help of these insights and thus target the core need of the customer.
                    Now it’s not all as easy as it sounds, applying big data to digital marketing is definitely great, but one also needs to factor that big data can be overwhelming. Getting insights from big data requires the use of analytical tools so that the data can speak and give valuable insights.
                    So that the insights are received in time, and the companies can understand the data in a speedy manner, data visualisation tools are used to derive actionable insights.
                    Decisions are based on studying the data points collectively, where the marketing team can look at facts and then base their decisions.

            <div class="row align-items-center adv-content-row">
                <div class="col-sm-8">Large swarms of data from multiple sources reveal information on issues like an increase in global temperature, emission rate of carbon, and areas prone to natural calamities. Such data can be assimilated and analyzed. The analysis will help reveal the hidden patterns in data, find the correlation between data sets, and offer actionable insights.
                    Examples of real-time analysis platforms that use big data are:
                    Google Earth Engine - Google Earth Engine is a platform that “stores satellite imagery, organizes it, and makes it available for the first time for global-scale data mining.”
                    Global Forest Power - Global Forest Power gathers data about forest areas across the world, providing information on the occurrence of forest fires, and deforestation, if any.
                    Change in climate is scary. We cannot entirely avoid the occurrence of a disaster but we can surely predict its occurrence and take the necessary steps well in time. Predictive analytics and big data can together help fight climate change strongly.

                <div class="col-sm-8"> It is safe to say that digital communication and Big Data have now become intertwined. 
                        Google depends on the analysis of large chunks of web and user data to power its Google Search services.
                         The same is true for Facebook and Twitter that use data analytics on a massive scale to deliver targeted contents and advertisements. 
                         Companies such as Amazon, as well as Netflix regularly crunch data obtained from their customers to improve service delivery,
                          as well as implement a personalized user experience. Nevertheless, the relevance of Big Data on online-enabled businesses stems
                        from the fact the more people are becoming dependent on digital communications.
                         Hence, these businesses are utilizing the data generated by these online users to maintain their competitive advantage.

                        The data revolution -- which encompasses the open data movement, the rise of crowdsourcing, new ICTs for data collection, 
                        and the explosion in the availability of big data, together with the emergence of artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things -- is already transforming society.
                        Advances in computing and data science now make it possible to process and analyse big data in real time. New insights gleaned from such data mining can complement official statistics and survey data, adding depth and nuance to information on human behaviours and experiences. 
                        The integration of this new data with traditional data should produce high-quality information that is more detailed, timely and relevant.

                <div class="col-sm-8">
                    Another common use for big data analytics — particularly in the financial services industry — 
                    is fraud detection. One of the big advantages of big data analytics systems that rely on 
                    machine learning is that they are excellent at detecting patterns and anomalies. 
                    These abilities can give banks and credit card companies the ability to spot stolen credit cards 
                    or fraudulent purchases, often before the cardholder even knows that something is wrong.

                    For business organizations, one advantage of Big Data is that it enables them to 
                    understand their customers or target market, particularly their behaviors and preferences. 
                    Doing so allow them to provide better products or services, develop new products in consideration 
                    of trends in the market, predict consumption patterns and behaviors to provide appropriate marketing 
                    responses, and provide better customer experience such as the inclusion of value-added services 
                    and after-sales services.
